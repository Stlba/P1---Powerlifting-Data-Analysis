### **Powerlifting Data Analysis**
Early-concepts of dataexploration, wrangling & analysis of OpenPowerlifting's Dataset. 
1. Better estimation than Wilks and how bias is Wilks?
2. Which important body traits correlate with total strength?
3. Is there a significant difference in strength among top level-lifters in drug-tested and non-drug-tested federations?
4. Linear regression with a polynomial basis to predect a lifter's bodyweight achieving a RMSE of 0.0202.

### What I learned 
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Sciby
* Pandas
* Numby
* Scikit-Learn
* Fitting Regression Models in Practice
* Model Fitting Workflow in Python

### Includes

- Meets pr. Country
- Most popular / least popular contries
- Which country has the strongest / weakest lifters?
- Powerliffting Popularity over the years
- What is the median age, weight, strength categorized by gender?
- What is the media value of squat, benchpress and deadlift sorted after each weightclass?
- What's the highest and lowest Wilks Score?
- Using dataset to categorize each liffter into an estimation of skillset [Beginner, Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, Elite]
- Estimation of athlete potential by measuring the following mechanical biofactors:
1. Age
2. Gender
3. Weight
4. Height
5. Muscle mass
6. Training age
7. Muscle architecture
8. Body segment lengths
9. Other stuff
- How big of an influence is gender in Powerlifting? Bias?
