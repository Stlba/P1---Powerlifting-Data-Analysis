#### Wilks Radarchart showing bias

*"Mass Moves Mass"* is as true as it will ever be, when skimming through OpenPowerLifting Dataset. Numerous mathematical models have been developed to compare relative strength between different weightclasses as a method to counter the natural hierarchy of mechanical strength, which places absolute strength at the absolute top. One of these mathematical models is *Wilks* and is currently the most used comparison method in the Powerlifting Community, however, Wilks is definitely not perfect and shows a significant gender bias favoring men, while also showing an age bias favoring the Open class. The 2020-version of Wilks-coefficent is as follows:

Therefore the goal should be to check if there's any surviving bias in the 2020-version compared to earlier versions with significant bias.

#### Overview of weighted variables & relevant plot to every variable:

› Age Distribution 

› Meets pr. Country

› Most popular / least popular contries

› Which country has the strongest / weakest lifters?

› Powerlifting Popularity over the years

› What is the median age, weight, strength categorized by gender?

› What is the media value of squat, benchpress and deadlift sorted after each weightclass?

› What's the highest and lowest Wilks Score?

› Using dataset to categorize each liffter into an estimation of skillset [Beginner, Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, Elite]

› Estimation of athlete potential by measuring the following mechanical biofactors: [Age, Gender, Weight, Height, Muscle Mass, Training Age, Muscle Architecture, Body Segment Lengths]
