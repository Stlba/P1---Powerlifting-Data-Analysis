### **Powerlifting Data Analysis**
Early-concepts of dataexploration, wrangling & analysis of OpenPowerlifting's Dataset. 
1. Better estimation than Wilks and how bias is Wilks?
2. Which important body traits correlate with total strength?
3. Is there a significant difference in strength among top level-lifters in drug-tested and non-drug-tested federations?
4. Linear regression with a polynomial basis to predect a lifter's bodyweight achieving a RMSE of 0.0202.

### What I learned 
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Sciby
* Pandas
* Numby
* Scikit-Learn
* Fitting Regression Models in Practice
* Model Fitting Workflow in Python
