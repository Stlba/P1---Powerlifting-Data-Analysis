## **Powerlifting Data Analysis**
Early-concepts of dataexploration, wrangling & analysis of OpenPowerlifting's Dataset. 


## Includes
1. Wilks Radarchart showing bias.
2. Correlation Heatmap w. variables for visualising of linear prediction.
3. Difference in strength-level between tested and non-tested federations.
4. Using linear regression and weight of variables of maximum lift in squat, benchpress and deadlift to predict the athletes supposed weight. 
5. Using Logistic Regression of maximum lift in squat, benchpress and deadlift to design model for predicting gender 
6. Overview of weighted variables & relevant plot to every variable:
[Histogram] Age Distribution 
[Boxplot] Meets pr. Country
[Boxplot] Most popular / least popular contries
[Boxplot] Which country has the strongest / weakest lifters?
[Boxplot] Powerliffting Popularity over the years
[Plot?] What is the median age, weight, strength categorized by gender?
[Plot?] What is the media value of squat, benchpress and deadlift sorted after each weightclass?
[Plot?] What's the highest and lowest Wilks Score?
[Regression] Using dataset to categorize each liffter into an estimation of skillset [Beginner, Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, Elite]
[Regression] Estimation of athlete potential by measuring the following mechanical biofactors:
###### - Age
###### - Gender
###### - Weight
###### - Height
###### - Muscle mass
###### - Training age
###### - Muscle architecture
###### - Body segment lengths
